# Open Science and a Publishing Utopia — A GenR Theme

[#PublishingUtopia](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PublishingUtopia&src=typed_query&f=live)

_What are the current development that will lead to a utopian free circulation of knowledge?_

Utopia is the vision of an ideal future state of the world. A criticism of such utopia’s is that they serve as  unattainable fictions, always just out of reach. But this is not the case with Open Science and publishing and for once the future is within our grasp. A future where there could be global Open Access, much wider participation in scholarship. and a techstack for open data and semantic workflows. 
In this theme the idea is to look at what this future publishing world would look like and how would we the benefits from a frictionless and interoperable publishing systems. The example benefits of putting humanity's knowledge to work are to improve research replication rates in research to ensure better rates of drug discovery, or to tackle climate change where OA rates are still at less than 30%. (Tai and Robinson 2018)

The building blocks for future publishing are in place — preprints, open peer review, OA mandates, etc. —  and the appetite for change is there, especially from a globally expanding higher education student readership who are excluded from humanity's knowledge as borne out by Joe Karaganis’s MIT Press OA book [‘Shadow Libraries’](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/shadow-libraries), which looks at how huge swaths of the population are failed by our current publishing systems and are left with no other option than to take matters into their own hands.

## Open research/Open scholarship/Open science publishing?

Open Science Publishing means to make a publication that is linked to the whole research cycle, with all digital objects and related code tooling open. For a publication to be fully Open Access, licenced for the four open freedoms - to use, study, share and improve - and be 'copy left' licenced so all derivative work is also open. To be technically interoperable using open standards, semantically encoded and use controlled vovabularies, taxonomies and PIDs, and have all its sub components as discrete digital objects. Where needed to support 'computational papers' technologies. To use versioning, continous integration for real-time validation of open standards, etc., with open source code to allow for multi-format replication with software citation. To support fair metrics, granular annotation, social book/reading features, but prevent reader intrusive tracking, and support deep linking. Lastly to support detailed attribution and roles and not to prohibit publishing or reading with unecessary charges, moving fees away from these two points in the publcation lifecycle.

Technical (more so)

 - Open Peer Review
 - Preprints
 - Computational papers
 - Publication PID
 - Person PID
 - Organisation PID
 
Social (more so)

 - Company open data - https://opencorporates.com/
 - CoC
 - Open IPR licencing
 - Copy left - derivative works have to be open licenced
 - Four freedoms: use, study, share and improve
