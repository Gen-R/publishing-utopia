# Open Science and a Publishing Utopia — A GenR Theme

_What are the current development that will lead to a utopian free circulation of knowledge?_

Utopia is the vision of an ideal future state of the world. A criticism of such utopia’s is that they serve as  unattainable fictions, always just out of reach. But this is not the case with Open Science and publishing and for once the future is within our grasp. A future where there could be global Open Access, much wider participation in scholarship. and a techstack for open data and semantic workflows. 
In this theme the idea is to look at what this future publishing world would look like and how would we the benefits from a frictionless and interoperable publishing systems. The example benefits of putting humanity's knowledge to work are to improve research replication rates in research to ensure better rates of drug discovery, or to tackle climate change where OA rates are still at less than 30%. (Tai and Robinson 2018)

The building blocks for future publishing are in place — preprints, open peer review, OA mandates, etc. —  and the appetite for change is there, especially from a globally expanding higher education student readership who are excluded from humanity's knowledge as borne out by Joe Karaganis’s MIT Press OA book [‘Shadow Libraries’](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/shadow-libraries), which looks at how huge swaths of the population are failed by our current publishing systems and are left with no other option than to take matters into their own hands.

There is an open call to contribute (Nov 2019) and you can find out more at the links below. Any questions or comments please DM [@Gen_R_](https://twitter.com/Gen_R_) or email [simon@genr.eu](mailto:simon@genr.eu)
